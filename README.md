# HomeAutomation
Home automation modules like water level sensing, pump/valve control, electric/electronic device control, security monitoring/alarm and localized weather station are written as seperate modules as and when implemented in my home. The code will be written as generic and customisable as possible, so that it can be reused using same components as listed.
